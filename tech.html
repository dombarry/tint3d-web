    <h2>What is SLS?</h2>
    <p>There are many forms of 3D printing, from the traditional extruded plastic that most of us have seen in the past to advanced powder binding. Traditional FDM and SLA 3D printing have enjoyed a wide range of color options, and it is time to make that easy for SLS.</p>

    <div class="tech-detail">
        <img src="sintering.png" alt="Sintering Material">
        <div>
            <h3>Heating and Lasering </h3>
            <p>To begin printing, a build chamber is heated, and the bottom is filled with powder. The chamber is warmed almost to the melting point of the material that is being used. A computer takes a 3d model and slices it into layers, and the first layer is melted into place. More powder is laid on top of this, and then it is lased again with the next layer. This is continued until all layers have been made, and a solid part exists within the block of powder.</p>

    </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Cooling and Unpacking</h3>
            <p>The powder must then be allowed to cool for some time. This has to be done slowly to prevent parts from cooling unevenly and warping. Once the parts have cooled, the block of powder can be removed. The block of powder is mostly unsintered, with sintered parts inside it which are then pulled out, and the unused powder is then recycled.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Post Processing </h3>
            <p>Once the part is removed it is ready to be post processed. This often includes media blasting to smooth off the part and remove any leftover powder. At this point the surface is prepaired and is ready to be dyed.</p>

    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <p>At tint3d, we pride ourselves on the innovative deployments of the technologies we employ. Using dye to alter objects is something humans have done for centuries. Dye also works great for SLS 3D printed parts, but it needs some special handling to be fully successful.</p>

    <div class="tech-detail">
        <img src="dye.png" alt="Tech Detail 1">
        <div>
            <h3>Heat and Dye Process</h3>
            <p>Our unique process starts with a heated dye bath. The combination of heat and pressure ensures an even coating that penatrates the sintered powder. We also implement a state-of-the-art jet system which eliminates the risk of scratching from hooks traditionally used, providing pristine parts every time. Once the dye cycle has concluded, the dye is drained from the chamber and the parts are sprayed down to prevent dye pooling that can lead to uneven coloration. </p>

    </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Drying Process</h3>
            <p>After dyeing, the solution is automatically drained, and each part undergoes a thorough rinse to remove excess dye. We finalize the process with a dry heating step, ensuring the dye sets perfectly and the part is ready to be handled soon after the process is done.</p>

    <div class="tech-detail">
        <div>
            <h3>Innovative Material</h3>
            <p>Our proprietary material guarantees not only fantastic color results but also ensures the parts have remarkable mechanical strength and longevity. By using dyes that do not interact with the material and instead coat around sintered material we are able to change color without effecting mechanical properties.</p>
